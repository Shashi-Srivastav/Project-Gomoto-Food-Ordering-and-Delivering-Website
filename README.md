Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring a work-in-progress replica of the GoMoto food delivery website. This project demonstrates my ongoing efforts in front-end web development using HTML and CSS.

The main objective of this project is to recreate the design and layout of the GoMoto food delivery website. While the replica is still a work in progress, I am actively working on enhancing its responsiveness across different screen sizes.

As of now, the replica may not be fully responsive, but I am dedicated to improving its adaptability to various devices and screen resolutions. By fine-tuning the HTML and CSS code, I aim to ensure that users can enjoy a seamless browsing experience regardless of whether they are on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

Within the GitHub repository, you will find the current state of the replica project. Please note that there may be limitations in its responsiveness at this stage, as I am actively working on refining it.

I appreciate your understanding as I continue to make progress on enhancing the replica's responsiveness. Your feedback and suggestions are valuable to me as I strive to deliver a high-quality and user-friendly experience.

Feel free to explore the project and keep an eye out for updates. I'm excited to complete the responsive implementation and provide a more polished replica of the GoMoto food delivery website. Thank you for your interest in my work-in-progress project, and I look forward to your continued support and feedback.

Project Description: GoMoto Food Delivery Website Replica

Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring a replica of the GoMoto food delivery website. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end web development, with a focus on HTML and CSS.

The objective of this project is to recreate the visual design and layout of the GoMoto food delivery website, which serves as the inspiration and reference for this replica. While creating this replica, I have utilized some images from the original GoMoto website template to achieve a faithful replication.

Using HTML and CSS, I have strived to recreate the key elements and features of the GoMoto website, including the navigation menu, search bar, food item listings, and the ordering process. By utilizing images from the GoMoto website template, I aim to deliver a visually accurate replica.

Please note that while this replica project incorporates some images from the original GoMoto website template, it is intended for demonstration and educational purposes only. The project does not intend to infringe upon any copyright or claim ownership of the original design assets.

In this GitHub repository, you will find the code for the replica project. However, no documentation or instructions are provided within the repository. The focus of this project is to showcase my skills in replicating complex web designs using HTML and CSS.

I encourage you to explore this replica project and observe the similarities between the GoMoto website and my replica. It serves as an example of my ability to recreate visually appealing interfaces and provides insights into my front-end development skills.

As you browse through the project, your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated. I hope you find this replica project interesting and informative, and it inspires you in your own front-end development endeavors.
